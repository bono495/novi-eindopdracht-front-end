## Imdb Api

We are going to use the Imdb api and therefore we need a api key. As I don't really care about this Api you can use my Api key: k_oovbykn6
The key is already defined in the code.

*Note the api is limited to 100 request a day*

## Installation

If you have Nodejs installed it should have come preloaded with Npm.
In that case you can just run:

```npm
npm install
```

After it is ready start the app

```docker
npm start
```

## Login

A default user is already filled in the login field but here are the credentials anyway.

Email: welkom@gmail.com\
Password: Welkom123

You can also create new users.
